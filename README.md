BJLinkLabel
===========

UILabel's link handling sucks. This adds tap handling and lets you change the active link attributes.

Based heavily on [KILabel](https://github.com/Krelborn/KILabel). This is basically just a stripped-down version of KILabel without the data detection and with some added convenience methods for manually setting links with a URL/range.
